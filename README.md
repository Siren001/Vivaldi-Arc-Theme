# Arc-for-Vivaldi  

Arc for Vivaldi is a custom css file that integrates Vivaldi's UI with [Arc,](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) a popular theme for Linux.

## Features:

- When the current theme is set to apply accent color to window, remove Vivaldi's header gradient.
- Use custom fonts in Vivaldi's interface, by default AFV uses Roboto/
- Dynamic 1px border around Vivaldi that persists even when Native Window is disabled in the settings.
- Hide Vivaldi's built-in titlebar when GUI is hidden.
- Use Arc's window buttons even when Native Window is disabled in the settings.
- Make tab stack indicators Arc-blue, like running application indicators.
- Scrollbars are more minimal.
- Use Arc's sidebar color even on light themes, unless using the opera panel addon.
- Use Arc's toolbar color for start page navigation.
- Optionally make the panel appear to merge with the Vivaldi menu icon, similar to Opera's panel.

----

Because Vivaldi features a built-in theme editor, it is easier to create a custom Arc theme and then to use this CSS on top of that theme. This custom CSS is necessary to integrate with Arc because you cannot currently customize every aspect of Vivaldi from the editor.
